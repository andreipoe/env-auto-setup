# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.
# The sytax for each copy is: source > destination
# Source paths are relative to the goodies directory ("goodies/" by default, can be set using -g), destination paths are relative to your home directory.
# This means you can do "zshrc > .zshrc" to place your zshrc properly.
# Folders are copied recursively.
