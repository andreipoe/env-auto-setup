# Testing

`test.py` runs a somewhat random test case for each target type, except `batch`. To use it, just run `./test.py`; the script will print a success/error message.

A few things need improvement:
  * Absolute paths and file backups for `place-files` are not checked 
  * There is no testing for `batch`
  * Custom goodies directories are not supported
